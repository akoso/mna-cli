# mna

> Command-line tool for [My Next Adventure](https://mynextadventure.cloud).

`mna` is an open-source CLI for managing your trips on My Next Adventure.
It also ships as an agent skill — run `mna skills install` and your AI coding
agent (Claude Code, Cursor, …) can plan, research, build, cost, and manage whole
trips on your behalf. See [`skills/mna/SKILL.md`](./skills/mna/SKILL.md).

Status: **pre-1.0, alpha.** Tagged releases publish binaries to GitHub
Releases. npm and Homebrew distribution land with the first tag.

## Install

### npm (Node 20+)

```bash
npm install -g @mantacodedevs/mna-cli
```

This installs the `mna` binary. It bundles all dependencies as a single
JS file; no Bun required.

### Homebrew (macOS + Linux)

```bash
brew install mantacodedevs/tap/mna
```

Installs a precompiled native binary. The tap is updated per release; see
[RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md).

### Pre-built binary from GitHub Releases

```bash
# Pick the right artifact for your OS/arch:
#   mna-darwin-arm64.tar.gz   (Apple Silicon)
#   mna-darwin-x64.tar.gz     (Intel Mac)
#   mna-linux-x64.tar.gz      (Linux x86_64)
curl -L -o mna.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/MantaCodeDevs/mna-cli/releases/latest/download/mna-darwin-arm64.tar.gz
tar -xzf mna.tar.gz
mv mna-darwin-arm64 /usr/local/bin/mna
mna --version
```

### From source (development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MantaCodeDevs/mna-cli
cd mna-cli
bun install
bun run codegen
bun run build
bun link
```

`bun run build` is required before `bun link` — it produces `dist/mna.js`, the bin
target. `bun link` only creates the `mna` symlink if that file already exists, so
skipping the build leaves you with `command not found: mna`.

`mna` should then be on your PATH. See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Quickstart

```bash
mna login                          # opens browser for one-click consent
mna trips list                     # see your trips
mna trips show <tripId>            # detail view
```

If you prefer headless / paste-token login:

```bash
mna login --paste-token <key>      # generate the key from the user menu on app.mynextadventure.cloud
```

## Use it from your AI coding agent

`mna` doubles as an agent **skill** — install it and your agent can plan, research, cost, and
manage whole trips for you. **One command:**

```bash
mna skills install
```

It detects the AI clients on your machine, shows exactly what it will write where, and asks
once. After a successful `mna login` on an interactive terminal it offers the same thing with a
single `y` (silence it with `mna config set skills.prompt false`).

```bash
mna skills list                      # what's detected, and what's already installed
mna skills list --all                # every client mna knows how to install into
mna skills install --dry-run         # show the writes, change nothing
mna skills install --client cursor   # one client only
mna skills install --all --yes       # every supported client, no prompt
mna skills install --no-mcp          # skill only, skip the MCP server entry
mna skills install --scope project   # into ./.claude/skills etc. instead of $HOME
mna skills uninstall                 # remove the skill directory again
```

`--scope project` relocates the **skill** only; MCP servers have no project-level equivalent in
most clients, so they stay in the user-level config either way.

Installs are designed to be boring and reversible:

- **Idempotent** — identical files are left alone; a second run reports "already up to date".
- **Merged, never overwritten** — only the single `mcpServers.my-next-adventure` key is set.
  Configs with `//` comments or trailing commas (VS Code, Gemini CLI) are edited in place, so
  your comments and key order survive. The object being merged into may be re-indented;
  nothing else in the file is touched.
- **Atomic** — every write goes to a temp file and is `rename()`d into place, so an interrupt
  or a full disk cannot truncate a large config like `~/.claude.json`.
- **Backed up** — anything modified is copied to `<file>.mna-backup-<timestamp>` first (mode
  `0600`, most recent 3 kept).
- **Refuses what it doesn't understand** — a config that won't parse, or that has a non-object
  where `mcpServers` should be, is reported and skipped rather than replaced. That only skips
  the MCP entry; the skill files still install.
- **Isolated failures** — an unwritable path for one client doesn't abandon the others, and the
  summary reports what was actually written. Exit code is non-zero if anything failed.

### Supported clients

Every skill directory below is the one that vendor documents — sources linked, and `mna skills
list --json` reports the same URL per client so you can check without taking our word for it.

| Client | `--client` | Skill | MCP server config |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `claude-code` | [`~/.claude/skills/mna/`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) | `~/.claude.json` → `mcpServers` |
| Cursor | `cursor` | [`~/.cursor/skills/mna/`](https://cursor.com/docs/skills) | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` → `mcpServers` |
| Claude Desktop | `claude-desktop` | — | `claude_desktop_config.json` (per-OS) → `mcpServers` |
| Windsurf / Devin Desktop | `windsurf` | [`~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/mna/`](https://docs.devin.ai/desktop/cascade/skills) | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` |
| VS Code (Copilot agent mode) | `vscode` | — | `<VS Code user dir>/mcp.json` → `servers` |
| Shared agent directory | `agents`, `codex` | [`~/.agents/skills/mna/`](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills) | — |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | [`~/.config/opencode/skills/mna/`](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills/) | — |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini-cli` | [`~/.gemini/skills/mna/`](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/cli/skills.md) | `~/.gemini/settings.json` → `mcpServers` |

`~/.agents/skills/` is documented as a read location by Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, OpenCode
and Windsurf, so one copy there serves several agents. Worth being precise about what that is:
five vendors independently documenting the same path, **not** a spec guarantee — the Agent Skills
standard defines what a skill contains, not where clients look for one. Claude Code does not read
it. **Codex CLI reads only that path** — `~/.codex/skills/` is a third-party compatibility claim
that OpenAI's own docs do not make, so `--client codex` installs to `~/.agents/skills/`. Codex
keeps MCP servers in TOML, which `mna` does not edit.

Two caveats the CLI also prints, marked `(?)` in the plan:

- **Claude Desktop on Linux.** The Linux build is official (beta), but no Anthropic doc states
  it reads `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` — only the macOS and Windows paths are
  documented. On Linux `mna` writes the conventional path and tells you it is unverified.
- Anything else added on convention alone is flagged the same way rather than silently reported
  as installed.

The MCP entry points at the hosted server `https://mcp.mynextadventure.cloud/mcp`, written in
whichever shape the client expects — `{"type":"http","url":…}` for Claude Code and VS Code,
`{"url":…}` for Cursor, `{"httpUrl":…}` for Gemini CLI, `{"serverUrl":…}` for Windsurf, and the
`npx -y mcp-remote` stdio bridge for Claude Desktop, which has no native remote transport. If
you're logged in, **your API key is written into that config file in plain text** — that is how
these clients take credentials. `mna` sets any config it writes a key into to mode `0600`, and
says so before writing. Prefer OAuth? Use `--no-mcp`, or run `mna skills install` before
`mna login` and let the client do its own OAuth handshake on first use.

### Manual install (fallback)

The skill is plain markdown driving the CLI, so any agent that reads `SKILL.md` files can use
it. Copy it wherever your agent looks:

```bash
# from a clone
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && cp -r skills/mna ~/.claude/skills/

# from the npm package
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && cp -r "$(npm root -g)/@mantacodedevs/mna-cli/skills/mna" ~/.claude/skills/
```

The skill drives the `mna` CLI, so install the CLI (above) and run `mna login` first.

## Status

All command groups (auth/keys/config, trips, variants, destinations, options, events, access, vote/votes, goals, collections) are wired, CI-tested, and backed by live `/v1/` endpoints in production. Pre-1.0 means the public API contract is still allowed to break under `/v1/`. Once `1.0.0` ships, `/v1/` becomes stable; breaking changes require `/v2/`.

The contract of record is `https://api.mynextadventure.cloud/v1/openapi.json`. If a write seems to "succeed" but a field doesn't stick, re-fetch with `mna trips show <id> --json` to confirm — and check the request body shape against the OpenAPI schema for that endpoint.

## Configuration

| Env var | Description |
|---|---|
| `MNA_API_KEY` | Override the key from the credentials file. Useful for CI. |
| `MNA_API_BASE_URL` | Override the API base URL. Useful for local dev. |
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | Where the credentials and settings files are stored. Default: `~/.config`. |
| `CI=1` | Suppresses all interactive prompts, including the post-login skill offer. |
| `MNA_DEBUG=1` | Print error stack traces. |
| `NO_COLOR=1` | Disable ANSI colors. |
